Tic Tac Toe Game Project

Project Overview :
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, 
or diagonal row wins the game. This project involves designing and implementing a digital version of Tic Tac Toe, which can be played by two players on a computer or mobile device.

Objectives :
Create an interactive Tic Tac Toe game with a user-friendly interface.
Implement game logic to handle player moves, check for wins, and determine draws.
Allow two players to play the game on the same device.
Optionally, implement an AI opponent for single-player mode.
